No appropriate supplier method found!

    source type:   %1$s
    target type:   %2$s
    setter method: %3$s

    Consider ignoring "%4$s" or defining a method in the source type that looks something like this (if possible):

    public final %5$s next%6$s() {
        return new %5$s()...;
    }

    Feel free to choose another name for that method.
