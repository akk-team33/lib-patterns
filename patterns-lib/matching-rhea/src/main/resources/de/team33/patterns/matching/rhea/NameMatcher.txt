Not a valid naming pattern:

    %s

Problem:

    %s

Expected syntax:

    [METHOD[/OPTION]:]VALUE

    METHOD - Optional one of {rx, wc} (case-insensitive)
             rx : the VALUE is treated as a regular expression.
             wc : the VALUE is treated as the full file name,
                  but allows the use of the usual wildcards (?*).
           - Default: wc
    OPTION - Optional one of {cs, ci} (case-insensitive)
             cs : the PATTERN will be applied case-sensitive.
             ci : the PATTERN will be applied case-insensitive.
           - Default: ci
    VALUE  - A (constant) value to be applied to the METHOD along
             with the (variable) filenames in question.%n
