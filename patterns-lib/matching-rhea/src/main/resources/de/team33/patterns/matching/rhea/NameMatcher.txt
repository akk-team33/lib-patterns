Not a valid naming pattern:

    %s

Problem:

    %s

Expected syntax:

    [METHOD[/OPTION]:]PATTERN

    METHOD  - (Optional) one of {rx, wc} (case-insensitive)
              rx : the VALUE is treated as a regular expression.
              wc : the VALUE is treated as the full file name,
                   but allows the use of the usual wildcards (?*).
            - Default: wc
    OPTION  - (Optional) one of {cs, ci} (case-insensitive)
              cs : the PATTERN will be applied case-sensitive.
              ci : the PATTERN will be applied case-insensitive.
            - Default: ci
    PATTERN - A pattern value to be applied to the METHOD along
              with an argument (e.g. a filename) in question.%n
