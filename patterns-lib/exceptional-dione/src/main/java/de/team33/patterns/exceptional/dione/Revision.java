/**
 * A tool that supports a revision and handling of an exception.
 * <p>
 * In general, there is little need for a special tool for differentiated handling of exceptions.
 * The possibilities of Javaâ€™s own language elements (try-catch) are compact, expressive and efficient.
 * <p>
 * The situation is different if the {@linkplain Throwable#getCause() cause of an exception} is to be handled
 * in a differentiated manner. This often results in extensive and sometimes difficult to read code.
 * In any case, the regular code takes a back seat.
 * <p>
 * For example, in order not to have to deal with it all the time, we would like to temporarily wrap
 * <em>checked</em> exceptions into <em>unchecked</em> exceptions. However, we would then like to bring the
 * <em>checked</em> exceptions back to the fore in order to enforce a structured approach. A {@link Revision}
 * supports the latter, as the following code example shows:
 * <pre>
 *         try {
 *             return somethingThatMayCauseAWrappedException();
 *         } catch (final WrappedException caught) {
 *             throw Revision.of(caught.getCause())
 *                           .reThrow(IOException.class)
 *                           .reThrow(SQLException.class)
 *                           .reThrow(URISyntaxException.class)
 *                           .close(ExpectationException::new);
 *         }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see #of(Throwable)
 * @see #reThrow(Class)
 * @see #close(Function)
