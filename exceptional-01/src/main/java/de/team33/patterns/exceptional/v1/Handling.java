/**
 * A tool that supports the differentiated handling of an exception, especially its {@link Throwable#getCause() cause}.
 * <p>
 * In general, there is little need for a special tool for differentiated handling of exceptions.
 * The possibilities of Javaâ€™s own language elements (try-catch) are compact, expressive and efficient.
 * <p>
 * The situation is different if the {@linkplain Throwable#getCause() cause of an exception} is to be handled in a
 * differentiated manner. This often results in extensive and sometimes difficult to read code.
 * In any case, the regular code takes a back seat.
 * <p>
 * For example, in order not to have to deal with it all the time, we would like to temporarily wrap <em>checked</em>
 * exceptions into <em>unchecked</em> exceptions. However, we would then like to bring the <em>checked</em> exceptions
 * back to the fore in order to enforce a structured approach. A {@link Handling} supports the latter, as the following
 * code example shows:
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *     doSomethingThatMayThrowAWrappedException();
 * } catch (final WrappedException caught) {
 *     // We want to unwrap the cause of the caught exception and rethrow
 *     // it as a certain type of exception that meets our expectations ...
 *     throw Handling.of(caught)
 *                   .reThrowCauseIf(IOException.class)
 *                   .reThrowCauseIf(SQLException.class)
 *                   .reThrowCauseIf(URISyntaxException.class)
 *                   // Technically, it could happen that our expectations are not met.
 *                   // To be on the safe side, this should lead to a meaningful exception ...
 *                   .mappedCause(ExpectationException::new);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see #of(Throwable)
 * @see #reThrowCauseIf(Class)
